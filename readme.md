# Ember.js Development Starter Kit

This repo is an example of how to get up and running with the `ember-dev` package.
**This is not tooling for building ember applications.** This is
tooling for building addons for Ember.js or Ember Data.

This example builds "ember-data-local-storage.js". Look through the
source and figure out what's what.

## Up and Running:

Clone this repo and run: `bundle`.

## Helpful Commands

* `bundle exec rake` to run tests in phantomjs
* `bundle exec rackup` to run tests in the browser
* `bundle exec rake dist` to build your project
